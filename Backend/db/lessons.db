10,Application of Trees,Trees are fundamental in many areas of computer science because they can represent hierarchical and structured information naturally. They are widely used in searching and sorting algorithms where binary search trees allow quick lookups insertions and deletions. File systems and organizational charts are modeled using trees to reflect real-world hierarchies. Trees are also essential in networking and routing algorithms where they help optimize paths and connections. Additionally in compilers syntax trees are used to parse and evaluate mathematical and programming expressions efficiently. Their flexibility and efficiency make trees a core concept in data structures and algorithms.,5,2
8,Introduction to trees,A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It starts from a root node and branches out to child nodes forming a parent-child relationship. Unlike arrays or linked lists trees allow non-linear data organization which makes them ideal for representing structured data such as file systems organizational charts and expression hierarchies.,5,0

9,Types of trees,Trees come in various forms each with its own characteristics and use cases. A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children commonly referred to as the left and right child. A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree with the added property that all nodes in the left subtree are smaller than the parent node and all nodes in the right subtree are larger which allows for efficient searching insertion and deletion. More advanced forms such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees maintain balance to ensure operations remain fast even in worst-case scenarios. There are also N-ary trees heaps and tries which are used in specialized applications like search algorithms and memory-efficient storage of strings.,5,1
